The **Domino Points Tracker** is a user-friendly web application meticulously designed to simplify scorekeeping for your domino games. Tired of fumbling with pen and paper or error-prone mental math? This intuitive tool allows you to effortlessly add players, track their scores round by round, and automatically determine the winner based on a set point limit. It enhances the gaming experience with a celebratory confetti animation for the victor and intelligently saves your game history for future reference.
